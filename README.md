WhatsApp Product Review Collector 💬

A full-stack application developed as an SDE assignment for Hyperint / Eternamind.

This system automates the collection of product reviews using a conversational WhatsApp bot. It processes user inputs (Product Name, User Name, Review) via a state machine, stores them in a database, and streams them to a live React dashboard in real-time.

🚀 Features

Conversational Bot: A state-aware WhatsApp bot that guides users through a review flow.

Real-time Dashboard: A React-based UI that auto-refreshes to show new feedback instantly.

Robust Backend: Built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy for high performance.

Data Simulation: Includes a script to populate the database with mock data for demonstration purposes.

Fault Tolerance: The frontend handles backend downtimes gracefully with a "Demo Mode".

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn

Database: SQLite (Default for portability) / PostgreSQL (Supported via config)

Frontend: React.js (Standalone), Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons

Integrations: Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp

Tunneling: Ngrok (to expose localhost to Twilio)

⚡ Step-by-Step Execution Guide

1. Prerequisite Setup

Ensure you have Python installed.
Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder.

2. Backend Installation

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

# Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the server:

python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

The backend will start at http://localhost:8000.

3. Frontend Launch

Simply double-click index.html to open it in your browser.

It connects to localhost:8000 automatically.

If the backend is running, you will see "No reviews yet".

If the backend is off, it will switch to Demo Mode with sample data.

🔗 Connecting to WhatsApp (Twilio)

To test the actual chatbot flow, you need to expose your local server to the internet so Twilio can talk to it.

Install Ngrok (or a similar tunneling tool).

Run Ngrok on port 8000:

ngrok http 8000

Copy the HTTPS Forwarding URL (e.g., https://abc-123.ngrok-free.app).

Go to your Twilio Console > Messaging > Sandbox Settings.

Paste the URL into the "When a message comes in" field and append /whatsapp:

Target URL: https://abc-123.ngrok-free.app/whatsapp

Save settings.

Join the sandbox using your phone (send the specific "join code" to the Twilio number).

Test Flow:

User: Hi
Bot: Which product is this review for?
User: iPhone 15
Bot: What's your name?
User: Alex
Bot: Please send your review for iPhone 15.
User: Great battery life!

🧪 Quick Demo (No Twilio Required)

If you don't want to configure Twilio, you can use the included simulation script to generate traffic.

Ensure the backend is running (uvicorn main:app --reload).

Open a new terminal and run:

python populate_db.py

Watch the index.html dashboard. The table will automatically update with 5 distinct user reviews as the script runs.

⚙️ Configuration

Switching to PostgreSQL:
The project uses SQLite by default for zero-config testing. To use Postgres (as per the assignment requirement):

Open main.py.

Uncomment Line 14:

# DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname"

Comment out the SQLite line.

Ensure you have psycopg2-binary installed.

📝 Notes for Reviewer

State Management: The bot uses an in-memory dictionary for conversation state. In a production environment, this would be replaced with Redis.

Frontend: Built as a Single File Component (SFC) for simplicity and ease of review, eliminating the need for a complex npm build step.
